# Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js
- Node Package Manager (npm)
- Angular (installed globally)

# Running the Application

Navigate to the "Calculator" folder in your terminal.

## For Windows Users

On the first run, execute the following command:
    npm run first-start
For subsequent runs, use:
    npm run start-all


## For Other Operating Systems or Troubleshooting
If the above commands do not work, you can start the server and the application separately. Open two terminals.

In the first terminal, start the server:
    node server/server.js
In the second terminal, start the application:
    ng serve --open
